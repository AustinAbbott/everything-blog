Topic: A visit to Mesa Verde
Or (from my note) Things to know when visiting Mesa Verde


If you’re considering a trip to Mesa Verde, and we highly recommend you do, then read through this to learn all the things we did when visiting. 

A few disclaimers on our trip. Not only did we only go for less than 24hrs, we went on Fourth of July weekend, so our experience may slightly skewed to the higher volume of visitors, but there are still things we noted for our next trip there. 

The entrance is not a long drive outside of Cortez. I had always heard people from Cortez didn’t like to go because it was an hour drive outside of town. But it’s seriously 10-15 mins. So it could be a super easy day trip if you’re in Cortez and just looking to get outside. 

Accommodations: 
We stayed at Morefield campground and as they say on their website, it doesn’t fill up even on a holiday weekend. It’s super easy to book online, but they do have you check into the shop before you go find your spot so you have to get there before the shop closes. The shop has showers and a little store (though the items were overpriced) and a breakfast joint if you’re in a pinch. The showers were a very pleasant experience and welcome after a long hot day in the sun. 

Sights and activities: 
Before we went, we had no idea that you have to book a tour to go directly up to or in the dwellings. Once we found out, we trucked down to the visitor center that is back out the entrance and discovered they were all sold out. Don’t worry, if you end up doing the same there are still plenty of things to be see and do. 

Cliff palace: Tour would be ideal as you get to go up into them. Still a great view and there are good sights of the canyon. 
Balcony house: nothing to see if you don’t book a tour. 
Petroglyphs hike: 

Tours:
Book tours of the ruins in advance

We thought we’d be able to book our tour the morning of, but no. Granted, were visiting the weekend before the 4th of July, but still. Save yourself some hassle, and book in advance.

If in advance is not an option, book the tours before you enter the park, so you don’t have to drive back down.
