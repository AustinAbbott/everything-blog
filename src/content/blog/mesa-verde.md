<!-- If youâ€™re considering a trip to Mesa Verde, and we highly recommend you do, then read through this to learn all the things we did when visiting.  -->

A few disclaimers on our trip. Not only were we there for less than 24hrs, we went on 4th of July weekend, so our experience may slightly skewed to the higher volume of visitors, but there are still things we noted for our next trip there.

<!-- The entrance is not a long drive outside of Cortez. I had always heard people from Cortez didnâ€™t like to go because it was an hour drive outside of town, but itâ€™s seriously 10-15 mins. So it could be a super easy day trip if youâ€™re in Cortez and just looking to get outside. -->

Regarding the comment above, wasn't it actually way up there?

## Accommodations

We stayed at [Morefield Campground](https://www.visitmesaverde.com/lodging-camping/morefield-campground/) and as they say on their website, it doesnâ€™t fill up even on a holiday weekend. Itâ€™s super easy to book online, but they do have you check in at the shop before you find your spot, so you have to get there before the shop closes. The shop has showers, a little store, and a breakfast joint if youâ€™re in a pinch. The showers were clean, abundant, and quite pleasant after a long hot day in the sun.

## Sights and activities

Before we went, we had no idea that you have to book a tour to go directly up to or in the dwellings. Once we found out, we trucked down to the visitor center that is outside the entrance and discovered they were all sold out. Donâ€™t worry, if you end up doing the same there are still plenty of things to be see and do.

### Cliff Palace

A tour would be ideal as you get to go up into the palace, but it's still a great view without, and there are good sights of the canyon.

### Balcony House

Nothing to see if you donâ€™t book a tour ðŸ˜¢

### Petroglyph hike

A solid hike if you do the full loop. We managed to do the loop backwards, which gave us a chance to say hello to a lot of people.

## Tours

Book tours of the ruins in advance

We thought weâ€™d be able to book our tour the morning of, but no. Granted, were visiting the weekend before the 4th of July, but still. Save yourself some hassle, and book in advance.

If booking in advance is not an option, book tours before you enter the park, so you donâ€™t have to drive back down.
